= Todo List

== Section 1 - Motivations for the App

My motivations for this app are to gain experience to actually making an app, and because I'm quite a forgetful and a todo list is
a potentially useful application. Virtually everyone could be considered a user of my app especially those who are, like myself, forgetful. An example of a similar app is
Todoist: https://todoist.com/?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier, which is available on multiple platforms.

== Section 2 - Meeting Minimum Requirements

My app will have four screens, the first and main screen will be used for viewing, selecting, and managing lists. The second screen will be inside each list and contain the actual
items. The third screen will be for creating new todo items. The fourth screen will contain options for the todo list app. The app will save state when the screen is rotated
by using a view model.

Data will be stored via Firebase on the device itself. During the OnCreate of the list selection screen any lists stored will be retrieved from the database, also any options will be applied. Once a list is chosen, the items on that
list will be retrieved during the OnCreate of the list-items activity. The list add activity will add data to the database when the "Add" button is pressed. Finally, the options activity
will add to database when options are saved.

The app will have the ability to connect to internet via Firebase which will allow the app to sync it's data between other devices.

== Section 3 - MVC Breakdown of My App

=== View Description
All views in my app will be using the constraint layout due to ease of use. The minimum screen size that will be supported is a width of
320dp.

=== Model Description
Data the app will need to store:

	* The names of all lists
	
	* The todo contents of each of those lists
	
	* The notification/alarm/time/ and date information for each item on those lists
	
	* Options the user has set
	
	* Firebase Auth data

Firebase a NoSQL database will be used for storing the necessary data.

=== Controller Description
==== List View controller descriptions

	* openList, will open the Todo Item activity and pass that activity the necessary information to populate the todo list with all elements
	
	* addNewList, Will create a dialog that allows input of a name, then creates a new list with that name and appends
	a clickable button to the list with the correct name

	* editListName, changes the color of the list-buttons, and allows them to be clicked which will then bring up a dialog that
	allows the list name to be changed
	
	* openOptions, opens the options activity

		** This will modify the database by completely deleting the list
		
	* openOptions, opens options activity
